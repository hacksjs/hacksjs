Refactoring is the process of changing the structure of existing code without changing its external behavior and interface. The objective of refactoring is to improve the _quality_ of software, rather than its functionality. Refactoring work may focus on paying down technical debt or improving attributes such as performance, security and maintainability.

Use this template to log any work that needs to be done _urgently_ to address particular quality attributes of the software. Delete any sections that are not relevant.

Don't forget to apply the relevant labels and milestones to this issue, if it targets specific packages and versions.

## Details

Use this space to provide details of the changes that need to be made, and why. This should be as comprehensive as possible â€” assume you will not be assigned to work on this issue and that you will not be available to communicate your knowledge to the assigned developer.

## Acceptance criteria

If possible, define metrics against which the software can be benchmarked. Examples of analytics data that can be gathered to quantify certain quality attributes of software include:

- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
- Mean Time to Recover/Repair (MTTR)
- Application Crash Rate
- Test Coverage
- Open/Close Rates
- Lines of Code
- Code complexity metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity and NPath
- User analytics such as shopping cart abandonment rate

Alternatively, it may be possible to define acceptance criteria in terms of conformance to published standards, such as:

- 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to encrypt sensitive data in storage
- 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption for all data in transit
- AA grade for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
- EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) standard for handling of personally-identifiable data

## Cost versus benefits

If possible, provide an estimate of the effort required to deliver the changes. How does this compare to the cost of ignoring the issue?
