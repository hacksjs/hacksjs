<!--

Maintenance is any routine upkeep of the software system and other general housekeeping. This category of work includes the upgrading of dependencies and changes to configuration of tools and infrastructure. It also includes changes to other artifacts under source control such as documentation, specification requirements and test scripts. Trivial changes, such as fixing typos in READMEs, also fall into this category of work.

In some cases maintenance work may involve making changes to source code and configuration, for example to maintain compatibility with breaking API changes in updated dependencies.
