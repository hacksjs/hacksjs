# @hacksjs/universal

This is a package of pure ECMAScript utility functions enhanced with TypeScript-compatible static type information. A small number of components make use of host-specific APIs (such as Node.js and web platform APIs) where available, but always with pure-ES fallback, ensuring universal compatibility with all modern JavaScript runtime environments.
