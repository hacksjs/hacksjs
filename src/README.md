# Packages

Each sub-directory under `./src/@hacksjs` encapsulates the source code, tests and consumer-facing documentation for a single Hacks.js package.

Any directories prefixed with an underscore `_` will be ignored by the `npm|yarn run *` scripts. These directories encapsulate early prototypes for new Hacks.js packages, which are not yet published in the NPM package registry.
